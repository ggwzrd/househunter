## About

After the Angular course at Treehouse, I wanted to put in practice the new things that I learned in a real world project.
Here I combined AngularJS with Facebook API to give an better experience for the user while looking for a room/apartment/house in Amsterdam. Although the idea was good, I didn't wanted to continue this project using this technology because with all this data the flow became really confused and I decided to change framework.
If you are interested in what follows, checkout this repository: [house-hunter-react](https://github.com/giuliogallerini/house-hunter-react)

## What I learn from it

1. Using multiple controllers in AngularJS and how organize them making each element of the page self controlled.
2. Improved knowledge in the data flow in AngularJS.
3. Asynchronous request Facebook Graph API.
4. How improve UI performance with continues rendering and big amount of data

## Technology used

- AngularJS (JS Framework)
